# NNfromScratch

Implement a Neural Network from scratch for Columbia CS4995 course.
The network was trained on the cifar10 data set (30000 training samples)
10% of the training set was used for validation test.

Implemented:
Basic Neural Network
L2 Regularizaiton
Random Dropout

TODO:
Batch Normalization
